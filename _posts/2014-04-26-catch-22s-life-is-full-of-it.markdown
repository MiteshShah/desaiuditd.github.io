<p>Many times it happens in life, at least it happens with me; that you keep finding the opposites mangling around with you and it becomes so obsessive that every single fraction of your mind keep seeking that opposite meanings clashing with each other ever. Sometime it makes sense; sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes it just doesn't let you think the sane way.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2><em>Every "Now" has its own right time.<&#47;em><&#47;h2><br />
<&#47;blockquote><br />
But again this whole <em>"making sense"<&#47;em> thing, being sane or insane; is all about perception and I've always believed this thing about perception that it really settles the case just by saying these&nbsp; simple magic words that <em>"It doesn't matter because it's all about perceptions and priorities."<&#47;em></p>
<p>Anyways, the point is the world have always taken interest in contradiction and I just love the way this whole drama is created between those two entities within the contradiction.&nbsp;If you look closely around, if you see through all the things around, all the incidents that happen in our day-to-day life; it's just not that hard to find such catches.&nbsp;Life is full of contradictions, oxymorons&nbsp;and ironies.&nbsp;As we get older, decisions become harder and consequences become greater.&nbsp;Nothing comes without a price and everything forces you to make a small sacrifice. Unfortunately (and fortunately) for our generation, we now know the ramifications of the things we do, unlike the generations before.</p>
<p>While I am grateful for all that we've learned from earlier generations, I can&rsquo;t help but look at all the knowledge we've acquired as a reason to make no decisions at all. We know so much that it&rsquo;s hard to make a move without spending all your time weighing the pros and cons of every minute decision.</p>
<p>Then again, maybe we&rsquo;re just young and starting to realize that life is about choices. Life is about dealing with the shit&nbsp;and making the everyday decisions we used to leave to our parents. And I think that&rsquo;s what makes being in your twenties so thrilling and absolutely terrifying.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2><em>"We&rsquo;re still young enough to act like kids, but old enough to live like adults."<&#47;em><&#47;h2><br />
<&#47;blockquote><br />
Broke adults, of course. And being broke, we&rsquo;re faced with many more challenges and <em>"Catch 22s"<&#47;em> because we don&rsquo;t have the options that money can buy.&nbsp;So these&nbsp;twenties with all the vigor of a roller coaster, where it seems like everything is asking for a piece of your soul, and crossing the street comes with its own paradox, a list of all the Catch 22s of twenties that can&nbsp;drive you crazy:</p>
<p><strong>Life - Fun, Age and yourself:<&#47;strong><br />
<em>If you choose to smoke cigarettes, you are enjoying yourself now, but harming yourself later.<&#47;em><br />
<em>If we go tanning we&rsquo;ll be hotter, but we&rsquo;ll age earlier. So is it worth it?<&#47;em><br />
<em>If you&rsquo;re hotter now, will you get married sooner? And if you get married earlier, will it not matter how badly you&rsquo;re aging?<&#47;em></p>
<p><strong>College:<&#47;strong><br />
<em>Go to college to get a job, get a job to pay off college.<&#47;em></p>
<p><strong>Drugs:<&#47;strong><br />
<em>Smoke weed to do better work and make more money, spend all your hard-earned money on buying more weed.<&#47;em></p>
<p><strong>Bread:<&#47;strong><br />
<em>The cheapest food to buy, the most expensive to work off.<&#47;em></p>
<p><strong>Dating:<&#47;strong><br />
<em>When you&rsquo;re single you just want to be in a relationship, when you&rsquo;re in a relationship you just want to be single.<&#47;em></p>
<p><strong>Older Men:<&#47;strong><br />
<em>Date them because they&rsquo;re old, break up with them because they&rsquo;re old.<&#47;em></p>
<p><strong>Birth Control:<&#47;strong><br />
<em>If you don&rsquo;t take it, you&rsquo;ll get pregnant. If you do take it, you&rsquo;ll never get pregnant, ever.<&#47;em></p>
<p><strong>Tanning:<&#47;strong><br />
<em>Do it, look hot now. Don&rsquo;t do it, look hot later.<&#47;em></p>
<p><strong>Tattoos:<&#47;strong><br />
<em>Get them to piss off your parents, end up becoming a parent with tattoos.<&#47;em></p>
<p><strong>Broker Fees:<&#47;strong><br />
<em>You can&rsquo;t find an apartment without a broker, can&rsquo;t get an apartment after broker fees.<&#47;em></p>
<p><strong>Roommates:<&#47;strong><br />
<em>Can&rsquo;t live with them, can&rsquo;t afford to live without them.<&#47;em></p>
<p><strong>Alcohol:<&#47;strong><br />
<em>Drink to feel better after bad day at work, feel sick at work the next day and piss off your boss again.<&#47;em></p>
<p><strong>Beards:<&#47;strong><br />
<em>Grow one and get a girl, grow one and look like you live in Brooklyn.<&#47;em></p>
<p><strong>Friends:<&#47;strong><br />
<em>Need them for your sanity, lose your sanity when you&rsquo;re with them.<&#47;em></p>
<p>And the below one is just perfect&nbsp;in its own contrast way:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I hate the way you talk to me,<br />
and the way you cut your hair.<br />
I hate the way you drive my car,<br />
I hate it when you stare.<br />
I hate your big dumb combat boots<br />
and the way you read my mind.<br />
I hate you so much it makes me sick,<br />
it even makes me rhyme.<br />
I hate the way you&rsquo;re always right,<br />
I hate it when you lie.<br />
I hate it when you make me laugh,<br />
even worse when you make me cry.<br />
I hate it when you&rsquo;re not around,<br />
and the fact that you didn't call.<br />
But mostly I hate the way I don&rsquo;t hate you,<br />
not even close&hellip;<br />
not even a little bit&hellip;<br />
not even at all.<&#47;p><br />
And last but not the least:</p>
<blockquote>
<h2><em>Here is the Silence; So Loud....<&#47;em><&#47;h2><br />
